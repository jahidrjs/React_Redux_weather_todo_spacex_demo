# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

              Q : What is Headless CMS?
              <br />A : Headless CMS is mainly a backend content management
              system with no front end. we can get content via an API for
              display data on our front end.
              <br />
              Q : How can you Use WordPress Posts to create a Static JavaScript
              Blog? <br />
              A : we know WordPress is the most popular blog content management
              system. so after creating any post and publish we can access it
              via API and create an easy Nextjs Blog Page
              <br />
              Q : What is Redux? Why is it needed for React app development? Any
              alternative that you could recommended as a replacement? <br />
              A : Redux is an open source library for managing and centralizing
              application state. Redux is very important for a big project to
              make it easier for developers to understand when, where, why, and
              how the state of an application has changed and gives confidence
              that the application will behave predictably when it does.

              Q : What is the difference between collection and document in the
              NoSQL database? Explain how to determine when to use collection
              and when to use document, and why? <br />
              A: A Database contains a collection, and a collection contains
              documents and the documents contain data, they are related to each
              other.

              <br />
              A : Step 1: Set up your first run with Amazon ECS. Step 2: Create
              container and task definition. Step 3: Define your service. Step
              4: Configure your cluster. Step 5: Launch and view your resources.
              Step 6: Open the sample application. Step 7: Clean up.

              Q : What were the major challenges you faced during the
              assignment? What did you do to overcome those? <br />A : suddenly
              assign this task with my favorite platform - yeah I enjoy this
              task but the part of the major challenges started quickly from
              scratch by studying API requests and response data handled in a
              short time with my daily task. I just simply overcome this to pass
              some sleepless nights.
